## Purpose

This project aims to create databases and retrieve information in various methods using this Twitter data and compare their performances.


## Part 1: Creating Databases

Creating databases with 110,000 tweets and 550,000 tweets and comparing runtime to create.

1A: Write Data from Web to TXT file, this TXT file will be used for parts 1C, and 1D.

| Metric          | 110,000 Tweets | 550,000 Tweets |
